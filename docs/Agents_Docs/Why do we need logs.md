1. **Enhanced Security Oversight**: Logs serve as a vigilant sentinel, detecting anomalies and unauthorized activities, providing a comprehensive audit trail of resource access.
    
2. **Streamlined Debugging Process**: Within expansive clusters, logs act as invaluable guides, facilitating the swift identification and resolution/reproducing of errors by pinpointing bugs and failure origins.
    
3. **Proactive System Health Monitoring**: Through meticulous log analysis, system health is continuously monitored, enabling the prediction of failures and timely recognition of warning signals, thus preemptively averting potential disruptions.
