**Audit Trail and Debugging:** Traditional architectures often make it challenging to understand how the system reached its current state or to audit changes. Event sourcing naturally provides a full history of changes, making it easier to debug issues or understand the sequence of actions that led to a particular state.

**Temporal Queries:** With only the current state stored, it's hard to query past states of the system or understand the sequence of state changes over time. Event sourcing allows querying the system at any point in time, offering valuable insights into its behavior.

**Event Replay and System Resilience:** In traditional systems, if there's data corruption or a need to migrate to a new state schema, it can be complex and risky. Event sourcing allows for event replay, which can rebuild application state from scratch, facilitate migrations, or recover from system failures, enhancing resilience.
